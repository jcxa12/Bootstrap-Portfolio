### Description

With this website I sought to show my portfolio along with the projects I'll be working during the bootcamp.

### Modifications

* Added basic HTML.

* Added Boostrap navbar code to my file. Instead of a "navbar-brand" I decided to add my own image.

* I use "justify-content-end" in the "collapse navbar" option

* Organized the HTML file adding <div class> to separate the sections

* Added a jumbotron code.

* Section "My skills": I added the photos and a brief description of what I learned

* Section "My Work": I added a small image showing each of my projects and a brief description of each project. Also linked them with the current location.

* Created a README.md file
